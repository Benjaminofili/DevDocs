    description: 'Title, badges, and short description',
    whyImportant: `The header is the first thing people see. It tells them instantly what your project does 
    and shows professionalism through badges (build status, version, license). Recruiters often spend 
    less than 30 seconds on a README - make those seconds count!`,
    howToWrite: `1. Start with your project name as an H1
2. Add a one-line description that answers "What does this do?"
3. Include relevant badges (we'll generate these for you)
4. Optionally add a screenshot or demo GIF`,

    description: 'Key features and capabilities',
    whyImportant: `Features help users quickly understand if your project solves their problem. 
    It's also a great way to showcase your technical skills to potential employers!`,
    howToWrite: `List 4-6 main features using bullet points. Each feature should:
- Start with an emoji for visual appeal

2. Install dependencies
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the project`,

    id: 'environment',
    name: 'Environment Variables',
    description: 'Required environment configuration',
    whyImportant: `Environment variables keep sensitive data (API keys, database URLs) secure. 
    Documenting them prevents the #1 setup issue: "It works on my machine!"`,
    howToWrite: `Create a table with:
- Variable name
- Description
- Example value (never real secrets!)
- Whether it's required`,

    description: 'API endpoints and usage',
    whyImportant: `If your project has an API, documenting it is crucial. 
    Good API docs can make or break developer adoption of your project.`,

    It helps users actually USE your project, not just look at the code.`,
    howToWrite: `Include:
- Recommended hosting platform
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Any special configuration needed`,
    isRecommended: true,
    isRequired: false,

  },
  {
    id: 'license',
    name: 'License',
    description: 'Project license information',
    whyImportant: `A license tells others how they can use your code. Without one, 
    your project is technically "all rights reserved" - not truly open source!`,
    howToWrite: `Simply state the license type and link to the full text.
    Common choices:
    - MIT: Very permissive, good for portfolios
    - Apache 2.0: Like MIT but with patent protection
    - GPL: Requires derivative works to also be open source`,
